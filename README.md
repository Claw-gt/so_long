## Introduction
**So_long** is a basic graphic design project, for which the MiniLibX campus graphics library has been used. This library has been developed
internally and includes the basic tools needed to open a window, create images and work with
images and keyboard and mouse events.

My project is based on the game **"Undertale"**.
